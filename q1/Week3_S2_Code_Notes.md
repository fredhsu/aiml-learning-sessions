# Week3_S2_Code_Notes

## What I implemented:

- Softmax and Cross entropy using logsumexp
- Mini batch training using the above
- Manual gradient testing of the network

## Known limitations

- Vectors are handled in logsumexp but not broadly for the network

## Next obvious refactor

- Add proper vector / matrix functions
