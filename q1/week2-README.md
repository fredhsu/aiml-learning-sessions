# Week 2 Session

## What works

- The overall functionality works, and is verified with the numerical gradient calculation.
- There are abstractions for the various layers and neurons that are functional.
- The XOR training mostly works

## What's hacky

- Keeping track of the parameters and manual creation of the Value objects

## What I'll improve

- Better debugging output
- Number coercion
- Clean up based on code review
