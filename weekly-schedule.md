# Weekly Schedule by Quarter (2026)

**Global rules (all quarters)**

- **4–6 total sessions/week**
- Sessions are **60–90 minutes**
- Stop mid-problem if needed → restart next session
- One session/week is always **output-focused**

---

## **Q1 (Foundations & Backprop)**

**Cognitive load:** High, abstract

### Weekly cadence

**Session 1 – Math & Derivations**

- Gradients, Jacobians, chain rule
- Re-derive one thing you “already know”

**Session 2 – Code from Scratch**

- micrograd-style engine
- Tiny tests, scalar → vector

**Session 3 – Read Actively**

- One paper / chapter
- Rewrite core idea in your own notation

**Session 4 – Write / Teach**

- Notes, diagrams, or a short explainer
- Aim for clarity, not polish

**Optional Session 5 – Non-Technical**

- Philosophy/history reading
- Write 5–10 bullets connecting to ML

---

## **Q2 (Attention & Representations)**

**Cognitive load:** Medium–high, more geometric

### Weekly cadence

**Session 1 – Linear Algebra in Practice**

- Projections, embeddings, similarity
- Small numerical examples

**Session 2 – Build Attention**

- Implement one component (Q/K/V, softmax)
- No abstractions yet

**Session 3 – Experiment**

- Tiny datasets
- Change one variable, observe

**Session 4 – Visual Explanation**

- Draw attention maps or flow diagrams
- Explain to a hypothetical audience

**Optional Session 5 – Non-Technical**

- Visual thinking / drawing
- Diagram something unrelated to ML

---

## **Q3 (Systems & Training Dynamics)**

**Cognitive load:** Medium, experimental

### Weekly cadence

**Session 1 – Training Theory**

- Batch size, LR schedules
- Predict outcome before running

**Session 2 – Systems Build**

- Data pipeline, training loop, logging

**Session 3 – Run & Break Things**

- Let something fail
- Inspect metrics, gradients, loss curves

**Session 4 – Analysis**

- Ablations
- Write “what surprised me”

**Optional Session 5 – Non-Technical**

- Judgment, decision-making, bias
- One real-life application per week

---

## **Q4 (Synthesis & Teaching)**

**Cognitive load:** Lower, integrative

### Weekly cadence

**Session 1 – Refactor & Simplify**

- Remove complexity
- Rename things for clarity

**Session 2 – Write Long-Form**

- Blog post, essay, or talk notes

**Session 3 – Teach It**

- Pretend you’re explaining to a smart 16-year-old
- Slides, diagrams, or examples

**Session 4 – Reflect**

- What do I actually understand?
- What did I _think_ I understood but didn’t?

**Optional Session 5 – Non-Technical**

- Writing, narrative, or reading for pleasure

---

## Built-In Safety Valves

- **Bad week?** Do only:
  - 1 build session
  - 1 write session

- **Great week?** Add experiments, not new topics
- **Behind?** Shrink scope, never add hours

---

If you want, I can:

- Convert this into a **Notion or Obsidian weekly template**
- Map this onto **specific weekdays**
- Add a **light tracking system** (what to log, what to ignore)
- Tune for **travel-heavy weeks**

Tell me what would help most.
