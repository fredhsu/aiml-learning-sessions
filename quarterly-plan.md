# 2026 Quarterly Roadmap

## **Q1 (Jan–Mar): Foundations You Truly Own**

**Theme:** _Re-derive, don’t skim_

### AI / ML (Primary)

**Goal:** Rebuild your mental model from first principles
**Focus**

- Optimization mechanics (GD, momentum, Adam → why they work)
- Backprop as computation, not magic
- Loss landscapes & implicit bias

**Deliverables**

- Hand-derived gradients for core models
- Minimal NN framework (micrograd-style, your own)
- One clean write-up: _“Backprop explained to my future self”_

---

### Non-Technical (Secondary)

**Theme:** _How knowledge is built_
Pick **one**:

- Philosophy of science (Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos)
- History of scientific revolutions

**Deliverable**

- 2–3 short notes connecting this to ML research culture

---

## **Q2 (Apr–Jun): Representation & Attention**

**Theme:** _Why representations matter_

### AI / ML

**Focus**

- Embeddings & linear representations
- Attention from scratch (no libraries at first)
- Transformer block as a composition of linear maps

**Deliverables**

- Implement attention manually
- Small transformer on synthetic or tiny real data
- Write-up: _“What attention actually computes”_

---

### Non-Technical

**Theme:** _Seeing structure_

- Design / visual thinking / drawing fundamentals

**Deliverable**

- Diagrams explaining attention or optimization (for humans)

---

## **Q3 (Jul–Sep): Systems & Scale Intuition**

**Theme:** _From models to systems_

### AI / ML

**Focus**

- Training dynamics at scale (batch size, LR schedules)
- Simple distributed intuition (even simulated)
- Evaluation: what metrics actually tell you

**Deliverables**

- End-to-end mini training pipeline
- Ablation experiments
- Write-up: _“What broke when I scaled this”_

---

### Non-Technical

**Theme:** _Judgment & decision-making_

- Cognitive bias, forecasting, or applied epistemology

**Deliverable**

- Short essay: _“Where my ML intuition fails”_

---

## **Q4 (Oct–Dec): Synthesis & Teaching**

**Theme:** _Consolidation beats novelty_

### AI / ML

**Focus**

- Revisit earlier work with clarity
- Refactor, simplify, remove cleverness
- Choose one thing to explain publicly

**Deliverables**

- Polished repo or demo
- Long-form synthesis post or talk outline
- Personal doc: _“What I actually understand now”_

---

### Non-Technical

**Theme:** _Meaning & narrative_

- Writing clearly for non-experts

**Deliverable**

- 1–2 essays or blog posts for a general audience

---

## Yearly Guardrails

- **1 primary AI goal per quarter**
- **1 non-technical domain per half-year**
- If it doesn’t ship something → it’s optional

---

If you want next, I can:

1. Convert this into a **Notion / Obsidian quarterly template**
2. Add a **weekly cadence per quarter**
3. Define **success metrics** for each deliverable
4. Tune this for **family / travel seasons**

Just tell me which.
